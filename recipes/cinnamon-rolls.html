        </uo>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles,
                 then remove from heat. Mix in the butter;
                  stir until melted. 
                  Add water and let cool until lukewarm.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the milk mixture, yeast, 
                white sugar, salt, eggs and 2 cups flour; 
                stir well to combine. Stir in the remaining flour, 
                1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. 
                When the dough has pulled together, 
                turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 
                until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into two pieces. 
                Roll each piece into a 12x9 inch rectangle. 
                In a bowl, stir together the cinnamon and brown sugar.
                 Spread each piece with half of the butter, 
                 half of the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture. 
                 Roll up dough, 
                 using a little water to seal the seam.</li>
            <li>Cut each roll into 12 slices using a very sharp 
                knife or dental floss. Place rolls onto two 
                9x13 inch greased baking pans. Cover and let rise 
                until almost doubled, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, 
                preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes 
                until golden brown.</li>
            <li>To make frosting; combine confectioner's sugar, 
                cream cheese, butter and vanilla. Add milk 
                gradually until frosting reaches a spreading 
                consistency. Spread over warm (but not hot)
                 cinnamon rolls.</li>
        </ol>
